/* DrawElements represent a specific way to draw yourself.  There are currently 4 types, and when it 
comes time to draw, having a DrawElement means that it is specified what one needs to do to draw.
DRAWTYPE_NONE does what you might expect, namely, nothing.
DRAWTYPE_TEXT draws text in the default UI font unless draw_data2 is set, in which case it takes 
   that as a resource ID of the font to use instead. 
DRAWTYPE_BITMAP interprets draw_data as a bitmap to put in the relevant place.
DRAWTYPE_BITMAPOFFSET  interprets draw_data as an array of bitmap pointers, and uses callback data
    as the offset, and data2 as the limit, the number of bitmap states
DRAWTYPE_RES interprets draw_data as a resource ID to look into and find the right art to draw there.
DRAWTYPE_VAR just uses the value of the variable being controlled by the gadget to use as a display, 
   otherwise similar to DRAWTYPE_TEXT.  draw_data2 is reserved by the gadget to provide said data.
DRAWTYPE_VARSTRING uses draw_data as a char ** and indexes into that array depending on the value 
   of draw_data2 (as an int *), which is filled in by the gadget tracking that gadgets primary value.
DRAWTYPE_VARRES uses draw_data as an array of resource ID s to iterate through, much like VARSTRING does.
DRAWTYPE_VARTEXTREF uses draw_data as an array of string text Refs to iterate through, ala the other VAR types
DRAWTYPE_FORMAT is like DRAWTYPE_TEXT except that the text is first passed through lg_sprintf and the 
   draw_data2 parameter is interpreted as an (int *) and its contents passed to it as the content argument.
DRAWTYPE_TEXTREF is just like DRAWTYPE_TEXT but it takes in a string Ref
DRAWTYPE_FORMATREF is like DRAWTYPE_FORMAT except it isn't a char *, it's a string Ref.
DRAWTYPE_CALLBACK uses the draw_data as a DrawCallback, passing it's draw_data2 as the VoyBox pointer.

/* Okay, usage of this gets a little cryptic.  Basically, each byte of the draw_flags are used to control the
draw behavior of a different element -- bottom byte for border, second for internal, third for format.  There are
various defines for each type's control, these are the full DRAWFLAG_$TYPE$ defines.  For each type there is
a shift and a flags for getting at them.  Code that wants to look at it can just & the flags with the 
DRAWFLAG_$TYPE$_BITS define and then shift down by the DRAWFLAG_$TYPE$_SHIFT, and then compare directly to the
defines.  For setting them, there are $TYPE$ macros that allow you to set those values easy, by doing the right
shift for you. */
