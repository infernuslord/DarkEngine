// sent by renderers when they detect a display change. the filtergraph
// will arrange for the graph to be stopped and the pin send in lParam1
// to be reconnected. by being reconnected it allows a renderer to reset
// and connect with a more appropriate format for the new display mode
// lParam1 contains an (IPin *) that should be reconnected by the graph
#define EC_DISPLAY_CHANGED                  0x16

// sent by a filter when it detects starvation. Default handling (only when
// running) is for the graph to be paused until all filters enter the
// paused state and then run. Normally this would be sent by a parser or source
// filter when too little data is arriving.
