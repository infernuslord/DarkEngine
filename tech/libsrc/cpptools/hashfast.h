/*
  This hashing function is about 5.5 times faster than the cHashSet
  hash for searches and uses less memory but has several restrictions.
  1) Your structure needs to have an pointer entry called pNext, and an 
  entry called key.  You can inherit your structure from sHashFastEntry, 
  if you'd like.

  2) You need to manage your own memory, since your entry includes all 
  the hashing things.

  3) The hashing function is just a bit mask, so you need an even key 
  distribution for this to work well.

  4) For size, you need to pass in a power of 2.
  
  5) To get optimal efficiency I recommend making it a global, since then the
  address of the pointer list is a constant.
  

  Here's an example of usage:

  #include <hashfast.h>


struct sObject
{
   sObject *pNext;
   ObjID id;
   int num_entries;
   int pad[16];

   // Just return the id...
   inline ObjID GetKey() {return id;}
};

static cHashFast<512,ObjID,sObject> gHashFast;

void foo()
{
   sObject *pObj;

   pObj = new sObject;
   pObj->id = 32;
   gHashFast.Insert(pObj);

   pObj = gHashFast.Search(32);

   pObj = gHashFast.Remove(32);
   delete pObj;
}

// You can inherit from this structure if you'd like to make
// your entry.  Really the only thing your structure needs is
// for the first entry to be a pointer called pNext, and you need
// a function called GetKey to return the key.
struct sHashFastEntry {
   sHashFastEntry *pNext;   // the next entry in the hash table
};

// Iteration structure for a hashfast.
// Pass into IterStart to start an iteration
// Then call IterNext to get next one, returns FALSE when done
