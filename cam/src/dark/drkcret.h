//////
// What are creature types and actor types, you ask?
//
// Every creature has a creature type and an actor type
// All creatures of a given creature type have the same actor type.
//
// Creature type specifies the skeletal configuration and phys model size
// for a creature.
//
// Actor type specifies the set of motion schemas that make sense to play
// a creature of that type (every schema has exactly one actor). 
//
// Both are defined on a per-game basis.  Similarly, the creature type
// definition modules (crhumand.c etc) are considered game-specific, and 
// include this header to specify their actor type.
//
// Creature type and actor type are two different things because it's possible
// for two creatures to have different skeletal configurations but use the
// same motion captures (a legless droid and a human, for example).
//
// While we could have disjoint sets of motions to be played on two creatures
// of the same skeletal configuration (a human and a burrick, for example),
// I'm still making it so that the creature type determines the actor type.
// This is for simplicity, because tags can be used take care of this case, 
// and because things like humans and burricks probably need to be different 
// actor types anyway because of phys model size and placement.  
//
