// Proxy object manager
//
// In a networked environment, each machine "owns" some of the objects in
// the game. All of the other machines maintain "proxies" for those objects:
// simplified versions of the objects, which have the same archetype and
// position information, but which aren't as fully simulated as the real
// object.
//
// The proxy manager keeps track of hash tables that map between the real
// host objIDs to the local proxies.
