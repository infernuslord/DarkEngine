//
// Storage API
//
// Description of interfaces:
// 
//  IStore
//
//    Controls access to sets of items (streams) stored in a 
//    hierarchical fashion, and provides interfaces for stream-level 
//    data extraction, which is storage-implementation-dependent. 
//    An IStore is a collection of other IStores and IStoreStreams.
//    Conceptually, an IStore is equivalent to a normal OS directory,
//    but it may be implemented as a real directory, or as some sort
//    of file. The details of all this are hidden from the client apps.
//    The IStore is responsible for providing fast answers to queries
//    about what is inside it, although no specific performance
//    guarantee is made.
//
//    For efficiency, storages do a considerable amount of caching. If you
//    you have reason to believe things have changed on disk, call Refresh (),
//    to force it to look up the contents anew.
//
//  IStoreHierarchy
//
//    A side-interface from IStore. This allows a controlling system to
//    help establish a hierarchy of IStores, which may be of
//    heterogeneous kinds. For example, an ordinary file system may
//    have a stream called "textures.zip"; by aid of IStoreHierarchy,
//    this stream may be considered an IStore itself, and plugged in
//    as a substorage of the ordinary directory. IStoreHierarchy is not
//    normally used by user-level apps; it is intended for the utility
//    level managers.
//
//  IStoreStream
// 
//    Tied to implementation of IStore. Points at an individual 
//    stream within a structured storage unit. Conceptually, an
//    IStoreStream is like an open file; however, the item open may
//    be a real OS file, or a section of some other hierarchical
//    collection.
// 
//  IStoreFactory
// 
//    Like IResFactory, registers a set of implicit storage types by 
//    extension. Explicit assumption: we can distinguish between
//    the different storage types by their extensions.
//
//  IStoreManager
//
//    The top-level manager for a collection of IStores. Given a string,
//    one can go to the IStoreManager and ask that the storage named
//    by that string be opened. The IStoreManager keeps track of the
//    storage hierarchy insofar as is needed, so that things can be
//    found. It also allows registration of new IStoreFactories, which
//    can be used to open different types of storage.
//
//  ISearchPath
//
//    A collection of storages, which can be searched for a named
//    storage or stream. You add storages into the path, then look
//    for things in that path. An ISearchPath is conceptually similar
//    to the old Datapath mechanism, but works with arbitrary storages.
//
//    A path can have a "context", which is a higher-level storage or
//    path that contains it. For example, say that you have a large number
//    of directories, some containing textures, some sounds, some levels,
//    and so on. To make things more efficient and easier to manange, you
//    might want each of these to have a separate path -- the list of
//    texture directories, for example. But you also want a path which
//    lists the "roots" of these directories, so that you might have a
//    development root, a release root, and so on in this higher-level
//    path, so that a texture is first sought in the development area, then
//    the release area. This higher-level path is the "context" that the 
//    type-specific paths work within. (The highest level is generally
//    referred to as the "global context path", and can be registered with
//    the storage manager as such. From then on, all storages have a
//    "canonical path", which is relative to the global context.)
//
//    Note that, if you plan to use contexts, all of the storages in
//    this path should be relative. The results are undefined if you use
//    absolute storages in a path under a context. Contexts are strictly
//    optional; if all you want is a normal single-level path, don't
//    bother with contexts.
//
//    Set the context by calling SetContext (). After this, all Finds
//    will look through the cross-product of this path and its context,
//    searching the path under the first context root, then the second,
//    and so on. The context path is copied into this one, and that copy
//    will be freed when this one is freed.
//
//    Note that contexts may be nested almost arbitrarily deep -- a context
//    path may have yet higher context paths.
//
//    Search paths precompute the actual storages that exist, and cache
//    that information. If you have reason to believe that storages have
//    been added or removed, call Refresh() on the path.
//
// All of the above operate on a general abstraction of "storage", which
// is sort of like directories and files, but can also encapsulate things
// like Zip files. It is similar to IStorage, but operates at a slightly
// different level: the system is designed together so that the using
// application can essentially ignore issues of what sort of storage a
// specific level is. So long as all of the types of storage involved have
// registered factories, the system will automatically delve into any
// requested level.
//
// Some of the methods take a parameter that is the full pathname of a
// storage. This looks very much like an ordinary file pathname; however,
// the levels of the path may be files, as well as directories. When a
// file is encountered in a path, the StoreManager attempts to open that
// file using an appropriate registered StoreFactory; assuming that works,
// it just treats the file as a storage from then on. Thus, the pathname:
//
//    c:\dark\multimedia\textures\level1\brick.gif
//
// works perfectly fine, assuming that textures.zip is, say, a Zip file,
// and the Zip factory has been registered. Note that the file should be
// specified without the file extension; this is so that you can replace
// the directory "textures" with the file "textures.zip" invisibly. The
// Storage Manager will automatically try searching with the extensions
// for the registered storage factories.
//
// The explicit objective of this system is that developers should be able
// to work with all of their resources out in separate files, and then
// collect those files into a compressed format, without any code changes.
// You just change the names of the directories, and the code remains
// the same. In general, ISearchPath is intended to be the most common
// moment-to-moment interface for interacting with storage.
